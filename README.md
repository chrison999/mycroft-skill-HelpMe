A skill for MycroftAI that implements an internal help facility

## DESCRIPTION:

This Mycroft skill implements an internal help facility such that
the user can obtain help on how to operate Mycroft and any loaded
skills.

## CURRENT STATE:

Under development.  Currently, nothing has been completed but I'm
working on it.

## USAGE:

To initial this skill, the user will utter any of the following keywords:

  * "Mycroft, help me"

More functions and keywords will be implemented in the near future.

##### NOTE:

This skill is a _*prototype*_ of how a full-featured help facility
might be implemented in Mycroft.  Comments and suggestions for
improvements are welcome by emailing me at chrison999 (AT) yahoo.ca.
